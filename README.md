# 🖥️ Jake Abendroth – Software Engineer | Systems & Security Dev

Hi, I’m Jake 👋 — a Computer Science student at the University of San Francisco (Aug 2023 – Dec 2026/May 2027), passionate about building **low-level tools**, **secure systems**, and **open-source infrastructure** that devs trust.

I specialize in:
- 🧠 Systems programming (Rust, C/C++)
- 🔐 Cryptography & security tooling
- 🛠️ Software architecture & dev tooling
- 💡 Local-first agents, efficient runtimes, and AI workflows

---

## 🔍 Currently Seeking
**Summer 2025 Internship** in:
- Software Development
- Cybersecurity
- Systems Programming

Focused on high-integrity engineering, algorithmic performance, and solving hard problems with clean code.

---

## 🧪 Projects

### ⚡️ [LAO – Local AI Workflow Orchestrator](https://github.com/abendrothj/lao)
Chain local AI tools like Whisper, Ollama, and custom plugins—all offline.
- Rust DAG engine + plugin framework
- Tauri + Svelte UI
- Declarative YAML workflows with typed IO
- CLI + GUI for privacy-first orchestration

> Chain. Build. Run. All offline. No cloud. No compromise.

---

### 🛡️ Argus
A Rust-based file integrity monitor to detect unauthorized modifications in sensitive directories.
- Uses secure hashing, fast diffing, and alert logic
- Ideal for system auditing, intrusion detection, and config protection

### 🔧 BaseX Encoder/Decoder
Lightweight C library for high-performance BaseX encoding and decoding.
- Clean API for embedded use in security and data pipelines

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- 💻 Languages: Rust, C/C++, Python, Java, TypeScript
- 🧩 Interests: cryptography, system-level security, OS internals
- 🧠 Exploring: local LLMs, agent frameworks, plugin SDKs

---

## 🌐 Connect

### ✨ Let’s Build Tools Worth Trusting

Whether it’s chaining private AI workflows or auditing system-level activity, I love making software that behaves predictably, performs efficiently, and respects its users. Feel free to explore my repos, star what you like, or reach out if you're working on something meaningful.
