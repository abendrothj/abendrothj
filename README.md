# 👋 Hi, I'm Jake Abendroth!

🎓 **CS Student at USF** (Aug 2023–Dec 2026/May 2027) | **Looking for Internships**

I’m a developer driven by curiosity and a desire to build software that matters. I love digging into **systems internals**, designing **scalable web architectures**, and exploring how to make technology **secure by default**.

For me, coding is about understanding the full picture—from the low-level memory management in Rust to the user experience in React. I'm currently focused on mastering the intersection of **systems programming**, **mobile/web development**, and **security**.

---

### 🚀 What I'm Exploring
* **Systems Programming:** Building high-performance, memory-safe tools in Rust.
* **Full-Stack Development:** Creating responsive, robust applications with Next.js and TypeScript.
* **Security & Integrity:** Learning how to build infrastructure that verifies and protects data.
* **Local AI:** Experimenting with private, offline LLM pipelines and workflows.

### 💼 Career Goals

I am actively building my skillset to pursue a career in **Cybersecurity** or **Software Engineering**.

I am looking for **internships** and **opportunities** where I can:
* Solve complex engineering problems across the stack.
* Work with experienced teams on production-level code.
* Apply (and add to) my knowledge of security and systems to build reliable software.

**Interests:** Backend Infrastructure, Developer Tooling, Systems Programming, and Application Security.
