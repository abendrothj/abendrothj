# Jake Abendroth
**Systems Architecture & Application Security**

I build high-performance, memory-safe infrastructure and security tooling. My core focus is on systems-level Rust, POSIX vulnerabilities, and dynamic execution environments.

### 🏗️ Featured Engineering & Research

* **`uutils/coreutils` (Open Source Contributor)**
  Contributor to the cross-platform Rust rewrite of the GNU coreutils. Recently mitigated OS-level TOCTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use) race conditions utilizing `openat` for secure directory traversal.
  
* **LAO (Local AI Orchestrator)**
  A commercial-grade, multi-modal AI execution engine written in Rust. Features a custom Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) scheduler and a dynamic plugin architecture that loads compiled `.dylib`/`.so` C/C++ inference engines at runtime via FFI. 
  
* **Argus**
  A high-performance, multi-threaded File Integrity Monitor (FIM). Implements parallel SHA-256 cryptographic hashing to detect unauthorized filesystem mutations across massive directories.

* **Finlingo**
  CTO / Lead Architect. Managing the backend infrastructure and shipping cross-platform iOS/Android builds.
