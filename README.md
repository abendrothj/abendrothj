# 👋 Hi, I'm Jake Abendroth!

🎓 CS student at USF (Aug 2023–Dec 2026/May 2027) with a deep passion for **continuous learning** and **building with purpose**.

I'm on a journey to master **systems programming**, **security**, and **AI development** — not just to build projects, but to understand *how things work* from the ground up.

I believe the best way to learn is through **open-source contributions** and **real-world experience**. That's why I'm actively seeking **internship opportunities** where I can grow alongside talented teams and contribute to meaningful projects.

### 🚀 What I'm Learning & Building
- 🤖 **AI & Automation:** Local-first LLM pipelines, plugin architectures, and workflow tools
- 🧠 **Systems Programming:** Low-level development in Rust, C/C++ for performance-critical applications
- 🔐 **Security & Privacy:** Building secure infrastructure and robust verification tools
- 🛠️ **Open Source:** Contributing to projects and learning from the community

---

### 🌟 My Learning Philosophy

I learn best by **building** and **contributing**:
- Creating tools that solve real problems while mastering fundamentals
- Diving deep into **how things work** — from compilers to cryptography
- Sharing knowledge through **open-source projects** and documentation
- Embracing challenges as opportunities to grow

**Currently exploring:** Offline AI systems, trustworthy automation, and developer tooling that empowers rather than replaces
